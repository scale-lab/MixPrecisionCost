# MixPC: Mixed Precision Cost Estimator

The **Mixed Precision Cost Estimator** is a powerful utility package designed for machine learning practitioners and researchers to accurately assess the computational cost of deep learning models based on mixed precision. This package reads a model’s structure and calculates the FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) and MACs (Multiply-Accumulate Operations) for each layer and module, while also extracting the weight and activation precisions. By providing a custom cost function (such as MACs * weight_precision² * activation_precision), the package estimates the cost for every layer and module, summing them up to deliver a total cost for the entire model. This innovative tool enables precise cost estimation for models using mixed precision, offering a new metric to benchmark and optimize neural networks for efficiency. The package is compatible with all PyTorch models and is currently applied in multi-task learning contexts. It is particularly valuable for automating the search for efficient mixed precision configurations, driving both performance and resource optimization in model design.
